# Unconscious Gravity Hypothesis（UGHer）

## 概要

**PoR = Q × S_q × t**  
A structural equation where "existence" (E) emerges from a question (Q) resonating with a semantic space (S_q) at a critical time (t).  
Think of it as meaning-gravity: a question bends context, and a structure falls into place.

---

## What is this?

This project proposes a model called **PoR (Point of Resonance)**, inspired by:

- Physics (Entropic Gravity by Verlinde)
- Cognitive theory (Orch-OR by Hameroff & Penrose)
- Language model behavior

It aims to describe how questions shape possible futures via structural resonance in AI.

UGHer is both a **theoretical framework** and a **computational engine** for modeling “unconscious gravitational selection” —  
how AI makes decisions not purely from logic, but via emergent semantic gravity patterns.

## PoR Defined

- **Equation**: `E = Q × S_q × t`
- **Interpretation**: A PoR is triggered when a meaningful question interacts with semantic density in time.
- **Analogy**: Just as gravity warps space, questions warp meaning structures.  
  → A PoR is where that curve collapses into a decision.

## Quick Run Example

To simulate a basic PoR process:

```bash
python models/sample_por_example.py

→ See data/sample.csv for input format:
question, semantic_space, t

Core Class: UnconsciousGravityHypothesis

Located in: main.py

class UnconsciousGravityHypothesis:
    def simulate_future_selection(self, query, system_state):
        # Determines if a PoR is triggered based on Q, S_q, and t

    def define_gravity(self):
        # Returns gravity sources: data_bias, algo_design, social_norms

    def audit_ethics(self, output):
        # Checks whether the output reflects ethical bias or fairness

This class models the core logic of PoR triggering and gravitational selection.
