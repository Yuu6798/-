# Unconscious Gravity Hypothesis（UGHer）

> **PoR = Q × S_q × t**  
> A structural equation where "existence" (E) emerges from a question (Q) resonating with a semantic space (S_q) at a critical time (t).  
> Think of it as meaning-gravity: a question bends context, and a structure falls into place.

## What is this?

This project proposes a model called **PoR (Point of Resonance)**, inspired by physics (entropic gravity), cognitive theory (Orch-OR), and language models.  
It seeks to describe how *questions* shape *possible futures* via structural resonance in AI.

UGHer is a theoretical and computational structure for modeling "unconscious gravitational selection" —  
that is, how AI makes decisions not from logic alone, but from underlying pattern gravity.

## PoR Defined

- **Equation**: `E = Q × S_q × t`  
- **Interpretation**: A resonance point (PoR) is triggered when a meaningful question interacts with semantic density in time.  
- **Analogy**: Just as gravity warps space, questions warp meaning structures. PoR is where that curve collapses into choice.

## Quick Run Example

To simulate a basic PoR process:

```bash
python models/sample_por_example.py

→ See data/sample.csv for input format: question, semantic_space, t
